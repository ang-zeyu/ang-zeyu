### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am currently ðŸŒ±

- Studying for the AWS SAA certification, having completed CCP certification
- Picking up native android development (a huge WIP)

#### My most notable projects here are :star:

- [InfiSearch](https://github.com/ang-zeyu/infisearch), A semi-scalable end-to-end client-side search solution powered by a static pre-built index. Scalability was achieved by fragmenting the static file index into numerous files for on-demand retrieval. It consists of a multi-threaded CLI indexer written in Rust, a search library written in Web Assembly (Rust), and a user interface written in Typescript.
- [MarkBind](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aang-zeyu), An open-source static site generator tailored for education use cases, allowing users to write markdown, Nunjucks and various custom syntaxes.

#### Directory to other projects

These are some non exhaustive projects I've worked on as part of university coursework, and various smaller pet projects to pick up certain skills that I've uploaded to Github. For my professional work, you can refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ze-yu-ang-740168162/) and/or resume:

##### Mobile Development

- [IOT Music Song Recommender](https://github.com/ang-zeyu/IOT-Music-Recommender/commits?author=ang-zeyu) Team coursework project to build an IOT-powered music song recommender using ambient weather data.

##### Computer Graphics (C++) :framed_picture:

- [Simple Mesh Editor](https://github.com/ang-zeyu/Simple-Mesh-Editor) A well-featured but basic 3D modelling tool. This was initially part of a coursework. I had fun implementing many additional features beyond the requirements, ending with a proof-of-concept mesh editor.
- Many other less notable coursework assignments related to computer graphics I haven't uploaded. Please contact me if you'd like to see them, or we can talk more about it in person :slightly_smiling_face:

##### Misc.

- [A simple](https://github.com/ang-zeyu/dockerLinkedContainersTest) containerised setup for a react frontend, an express backend, proxied by an nginx container, showcasing basic familiarity with Docker.
